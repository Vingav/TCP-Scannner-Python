## Features

- **No External Libraries**: Operates solely on Python's built-in capabilities.
- **Multithreading Support**: Scans multiple ports simultaneously for faster results.
- **Command Line Interface**: Simple and straightforward CLI for easy use.
- **Open Source**: Contributions and suggestions are welcome to improve functionality.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vingav/TCP-Scannner-Python.git
cd TCP-Scannner-Python
```

No additional dependencies are required. Just run the script directly.

## Usage

To run the scanner, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python tcp_scanner.py [target] [port_range]
```

- **target**: The IP address or hostname of the target you want to scan.
- **port_range**: The range of ports you wish to scan (e.g., `1-1000`).

### Example

```bash
python tcp_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 1-1000
```

This command scans the first 1000 ports on the target IP address `192.168.1.1`.
